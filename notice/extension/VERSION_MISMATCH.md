## Explanation

The browser extension does not have support for the API Version of gterminal.  
  
This means your browser extension is outdated.  
If your browser extension is up to date, this could mean one of these things instead:
 - The browser extension has not yet recieved an update, because
   - It is still under development
     - This could take anywhere between minutes and days.
   - It was not yet reviewed by the corresponding Add-On-/Plugin-/Extension-Store for your browser.
     - This could take up to 24h.
 - The official gTerminal-instance was not yet updated.
   - This could take up to 15 minutes.
 - Someone messed up the version numbers.
   - This could take until someone [opens an issue](https://github.com/gTerminal-project/.github/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bugreport.yml) and then until it is fixed (which should take max 1 day).
